Hi, my name is Allan Soares Duarte. I am a software architect with over 9 years of work in technical leadership, strategy, startup development, delivery, and technical advisory.

| I believe strongly in a human-centric leadership approach. Very few initiatives fail because of a lack of aptitude. Rather, the people involved are not effectively mobilized to succeed. Building and cultivating strong teams, paired with effective relationship management and communication are the foundations of lasting success.

## Professional History

I started my career as web developer at 17 years old where I got some freelancer tasks. Afterward, I took a position as a web developer at A2C, a Brazilian company that BriviaDez bought later. In 2012 I started the college of information systems where my undergraduate thesis was the development of an android application that helped more than 7 thousand people who suffer from migraines and that was when I started working with innovation projects. After a few years, I moved to SÃ£o Paulo to work as Senior Software Engineer at Ateliware in the Santander innovation laboratory helping with three fintech projects where I worked for 7 months as a contractor. Subsequently, I worked as a technical advisor for the startup TapToGo for 6 months before finishing as a solutions architect at Gulf Capital Partners.

## Give Back, Become a Student Mentor

Software Engineering is a truly great profession. It is filled with passionate, intelligent, and hard-working people from diverse backgrounds. Best of all, we get paid to do something we love, which is rare. For these reasons, I feel it is important to give back where I can to inspire others to meet their education and career goals.

One of my favorite ways to give back. I enjoy giving advice and inspiring people to achieve their potential. Having a positive impact on someone's life is truly a great feeling, especially if you can help them avoid mistakes and pitfalls along their path to success.
