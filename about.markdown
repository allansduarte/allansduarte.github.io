Hi, my name is Allan Soares Duarte. I am a pragmatic developer working on high-quality code and evolutionary architectures.

I hope you find useful pieces of information on this site. If you have any questions or would like to chat, feel free to contact me via one of the methods outlined below.

## Professional History

I started my career as a web developer at 17 years old where I got some freelancer tasks. Afterward, I took a position as a web developer at A2C, a Brazilian company that BriviaDez bought later. In 2012 I started the college of information systems where my undergraduate thesis was the development of an android application that helped more than 7 thousand people who suffer from migraines and that was when I started working with innovation projects. After a few years, I moved to SÃ£o Paulo to work as Full Stack Engineer at Ateliware in the Santander innovation laboratory helping to build three fintech projects where I worked for 7 months as a contractor. Subsequently, I worked as a technical advisor and Full Stack developer for the startup TapToGo for 6 months where the core business is a marketplace for travel and leisure activities. Subsequently, I worked as a Full Stack Engineer at Gulf Capital Partners carrying out the CNN Brazil and Neymar app projects before finishing as a Backend Engineer at Stone Banking. Today, helping to build Stone.co's digital banking services.

## Give Back, Become a Student Mentor

Software Engineering is a truly great profession. It is filled with passionate, intelligent, and hard-working people from diverse backgrounds. Best of all, we get paid to do something we love, which is rare. For these reasons, I feel it is important to give back where I can to inspire others to meet their education and career goals.

One of my favorite ways to give back. I enjoy giving advice and inspiring people to achieve their potential. Having a positive impact on someone's life is truly a great feeling, especially if you can help them avoid mistakes and pitfalls along their path to success.
