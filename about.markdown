Hi, my name is Allan Soares Duarte. I'm a software architect with 9+ years of diversified IT leadership, strategy, business development, cloud transformation, delivery, and consulting experience.

Recognized for his dedication to innovating and your hands-on experience about scalability, helping several different startups in the past 5 years on these subjects.

I believe strongly in a human-centric leadership approach. Very few initiatives fail because of a lack of aptitude. Rather, the people involved are not effectively mobilized to succeed. Building and cultivating strong teams, paired with effective relationship management and communication are the foundations of lasting success.

I also write regularly on software architecture topics.

I sincerely hope you find useful pieces of information on my Dev.to and Medium channel both interesting and useful. If you have any questions or would like to chat, feel free to contact me via one of the methods outlined below.

## Give Back, Become a Student Mentor

Software Engineering is a truly great profession. It is filled with passionate, intelligent, and hard-working people from diverse backgrounds. Best of all, we get paid to do something we love, which is rare. For these reasons, I feel it is important to give back where I can to inspire others to meet their education and career goals.

One of my favorite ways to give back is to mentor students and young professionals.  I enjoy giving advice and inspiring people to achieve their potential. Having a positive impact on someone's life is truly a great feeling, especially if you can help them avoid mistakes and pitfalls along their path to success.
